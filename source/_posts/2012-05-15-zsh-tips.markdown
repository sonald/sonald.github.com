zsh is my favourate shell, it has a lot great features. here are some tips I collected from anywhere.

* the almighty 'Tab', at anytime, try press 'Tab' key, you may get something interesting happen.
* `setopt` to see all options set. 
* `^old^new` to fastly replace old with new from last executed command
* `!!:gs/old/new` do globally replacement
* history -D -40 -2
