Thoughts
--------
Recently I'm studying web development, first with rails then find my way to client side MVC framework 
backbone for the sake of rich client web app. here is some collection of my tastes related to web development.

### work
right now, I'm testing client MV\* with [backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/). 
For my own purpose, here are some random information that I found useful. just for a record.

### Blogs
- [Addy Osmani](http://addyosmani.com/blog) has a great blog releated to web development, he 
has recently joined [Google][].

- [Paul Irith](http://paulirish.com/) is another Google guru at Chrome team, check it out.

### Javascript
- [Object-orientation and inheritance in JavaScript: a comprehensive explanation][JS1]
- [Understanding delete][JS2]

### Backbone with Rails
here is an useful blog if you wanna try backbone backed with rails. 
[Backbone.js, Rails 3][blog1]

a good intro for [backbone-fundamentals][] and MV\* in client side.
