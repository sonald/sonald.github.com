* [a trip through GPU pipeline][1]
* [Learning Modern 3D Graphics Programming][2]
* [Inefficient Numerical Operators][3] 
    the author explored the numerical operator implementations described in ECMAScript 5 specifications, 
    and claimed that it's quite inefficient and unnecessarily complex. what's worse is that all numbers
    are acutally 64bit float-point values inside, which incurs performance costs.
