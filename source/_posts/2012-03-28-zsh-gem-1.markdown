zsh is my favorate shell, super powerful. there are a lot of blogs about it, and I recommend 
a book [From bash to z shell][book], and the site also contains some wonderful references.

[book]: http://www.bash2zsh.com/

Here I just wanna show some cool quick snippets of what zsh capable of, just for fun.
So guess what this does?
