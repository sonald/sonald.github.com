[Addy Osmani](https://plus.google.com/115133653231679625609) shared some tips about
improving learning process, and I'd like to share with you all.

he is author of some great free books about javascript, such as 
[Essential JS Design Patterns][jspattern].

* Be self-aware: how do you learn best? Do you learn best from documentation,
  step-by-step tutorials, hands-on approaches or with a visual aid? Do your
  best to modify how you learn to suit your personal preferences. If you can't
  find a knowledge resource in your format of preference, don't be afraid to
  ask if someone would be willing to do it in another form. Perhaps an author
  of an existing resource wouldn't mind doing a video or podcast on the same
  topic, especially if the material is still fresh in their minds.

<div class="span6">
* Set learning goals: what are you hoping to get out of learning something new?
  Is there a particular weakness you're trying to address? Define upfront what
  it is you're hoping to do better or be better at by the time you've completed
  your experience. If this means setting learning "milestones" on a personal
  GitHub project, go for it.

<div class="span6">
* Practice: Once you've completed a learning experience, create opportunities
  to apply what you've learned asap. This will help refine your abilities. Some
  developers try to find opportunities at work where they can apply what
  they've learned whilst others create sample projects or tutorials using what
  they've learned to share with the community.
</div>

<div class="span6">
* Do knowledge transfers: If possible, see if you can work with someone with a
  skill you wish to develop further. Maybe you can offer to teach them more
  about an area they're weak in in return (e.g "I'll teach you about LESS if
  you teach me about Node")
</div>
</div>

<div class="row-fluid">
<div class="span6">
* Don't be afraid to ask questions: The most knowledgable people are often
  those who weren't afraid to say "I don't understand this. Can you explain?".
  Asking questions is an easy way to gain more knowledge. It can be uneasy at
  first, but it's always useful to get other peoples perspectives on topics.
</div>

<div class="span6">
* Experiment: Try out new things, even if you find them uncomfortable at first.
  It's amazing how much we can learn from our mistakes as well as our
  successes.

<div class="row-fluid">
<div class="span6">
* Evaluate: We often play around with code and create new things without ever
  really stopping to evaluate just how much we've really learned. Remember to
  make time out to ask yourself "What did I learn from this?", "What worked?"
  and "What didn't work?"
