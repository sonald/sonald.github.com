iterm2 is a great terminal in Mac OS X. It has a lot of features
go beyond what you thought a terminal might be. here is a tip I 
learned recently.

Turns out you can select text without mouse in iterm2. just by 
press `CMD-f` to activate find. Enter some initial text you wish to 
copy, you'll find that the last matching highlighted with selected state. use `CMD-G` or `CMD-Shift-G` to switch selected text as you want and then press `tab` to advanced the selected text by words. To advance the beginning of the selection to the left, press `Shift-tab`. At most one line of text can be selected this way.


It's up to you to say if this is useful or not.
